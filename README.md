# FnF_Brawl
FnF Brawl Draft
Things to add:
  Set up the correct factions, and modify the loadouts to be more suited.
  Basic Medical, stamina, etc
  Wave-based respawns: Roughly every 15 minutes. Limited respawns per player. Ideally, 3 respawns for IND, 4 for BLU
  Faction locked camera
  Limit players to only picking up their faction radio
Objectives:
  Set up sector captures, with ~10 minute concurrent holding time required 
     If the sector is lost, they must re-capture and hold it for 10 minutes
     Once it has been held by BLU for 10 minutes, it cannot be lost
  VIP Capture - BLU obj to rescue 2 VIP and escort them back to their starting island. Both sides fail if VIPs die
  Set up uplink obj and destroy comm link obj at the radio station
  UI implementation of objectives so that commanders have a way to track progress (tasks, count down timer, etc)
  
Additional tasks:
  Set up briefing and appropriate map markers (points of interest, detailed markings for each side based on their intel)
  TBD
